    <h1>Cold Little Heart</h1>
      <p>Did you ever want it?<br>
         Did you want it bad?<br>
         Oh my, it tears me apart<br>
         Did you ever fight it?<br>
         All of the pain<br>
         So much pride<br>
         Running through my veins<br>
         Bleeding, I'm bleeding!<br>
         My cold little heart<br>
      </p>
      <p>Oh I, I can't stand myself<br>
         And I know in my heart<br>
         In this cold heart<br>
         I can live or I can die<br>
         I believe if I just try<br>
         You believe in you and I<br>
         In you and I<br>
         In you and I<br>
         In you and I<br>
      </p>
      <p>Did you ever notice<br>
         I've been ashamed?<br>
         All my life<br>
         I've been playing games<br>
         We can try to hide it<br>
         It's all the same<br>
         I've been losing you<br>
         One day at a time<br>
         Bleeding, I'm bleeding!<br>
         My cold little heart<br>
      </p>
      <p>Oh I, I can't stand myself<br>
         And I know in my heart<br>
         In this cold heart<br>
         I can live or I can die<br>
         I believe if I just try<br>
         You believe in you and I<br>
         In my heart, in this cold heart<br>
         I can live or I can die<br>
         I believe if I just try<br>
         You believe in you and I<br>
         In you and I<br>
         In you and I<br>
         In you and I<br>
         In you and I<br>
         In you and I<br>
         In you and I<br>
      </p>
      <p>Maybe this time I can be strong<br>
         But since I know who I am<br>
         I'm probably wrong<br>
         Maybe this time I can go far<br>
         Thinking about where I've been<br>
         Ain't helping me start<br>
